# Register of merged charities

## Observations on data quality

- The merger registration data is not accurate, especially the timespans between the dates of transfer and registration can go from -1y to 32y, but varies wildly even when outliers are removed. Ideally, this will be raised with the Charity Commission.
- [Merging two or more Charitable Incorporated Organisations (CIOs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities/guidance-about-the-register-of-merged-charities#merging-two-or-more-charitable-incorporated-organisations-cios) does not require the merger to be registered. Consequently, the register of merged charities will be missing this data. Does this data need to be FOIA'd?
