* Charity Commission register analysis
This repo will contain an analysis of Charity Commission register data.

For starters, the analysis covers the [[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities][Register of merged charities]] data.

See the [[https://github.com/harabat/charity_commission_register/blob/main/code/charity_commission.ipynb][notebook]] for the charts.
** Register of merged charities
*** Most frequent transferors
Most transferors are unregistered, exempt, or excepted. This probably indicates that most mergers are of very small charities officially joining bigger ones.

Most registered transferors have only been in the position of transferring charity once or twice: this makes sense, as a transferor will get merged into the transferee, as a rule.

In one case, a number of hospital departments seem to have merged into one entity (/The County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust Charity/).

/The Parochial Church Council of the Ecclesiastical Parish of The A453 Churches of South Nottinghamshire/ is the most frequent transferor among registered charities, having beein in that position 5 times.
*** Most frequent transferees
Without counting the outlier that merged 1200+ times, some transferees have gone through mergers >40 times.

Most transferees only go through a merger <5 times.
