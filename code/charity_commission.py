# # Charity Commission register: exploratory analysis

# %% [markdown]
# ## Roadmap

# %% [markdown]
# This repo aims to be an exhaustive analysis of the data released by the Charity Commission at https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/register/full-register-download. 
#
# Some of the questions we want to look at:
# - [x] most frequent transferors
# - [x] most frequent transferees
# - [x] evolution of number of mergers per year
# - [ ] the average time gap between each merger for repeat transferors/transferees?
# - [ ] what are the annual returns of the transferee before/after the merger?
# - [ ] what's the size of transferors/transferees in terms of annual return?
# - [ ] what is the median number of trustees per charity?
# - [ ] who are "repeat trustees"?

# %% [markdown]
# For starters, the analysis covers the [Register of merged charities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities) data.

# %% [markdown]
# See the [notebook](https://github.com/harabat/charity_commission_register/blob/main/code/charity_commission.ipynb) for the charts.

# ## Register of merged charities

# %% [markdown]
# ### Intro

# %% [markdown]
# The data can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities. 

# %% [markdown]
# Caveats:
#
# - The merger registration data is not accurate, especially the timespans between the dates of transfer and registration can go from -1y to 32y, but varies wildly even when outliers are removed. Ideally, this will be raised with the Charity Commission. 
# - [Merging two or more Charitable Incorporated Organisations (CIOs)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities/guidance-about-the-register-of-merged-charities#merging-two-or-more-charitable-incorporated-organisations-cios) does not require the merger to be registered. Consequently, the register of merged charities will be missing this data. Does this data need to be FOIA'd?

# #### Most frequent transferors

# Most transferors are unregistered, exempt, or excepted.
#
# The [Guidance about the register of merged charities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities/guidance-about-the-register-of-merged-charities#different-types-of-merger) states:
#
# > There are different types of merger:
# > 
# >   - merging with an existing charity
# >   - merging with a new charity you have set up for the purpose of merging
# >   - changing structure - usually a trust or unincorporated association that wants to change to a CIO or charitable company.
#
#
# The prevalence of unregistered/exempt/excepted transferors probably indicates one of two things:
#
# - Mergers of **very small charities (which are unregistered/exempt) officially joining bigger ones**. It's likely that these small charities are merging with larger ones to gain economies of scale, access to more resources, or to increase their impact. Alternatively, they might be facing hurdles due to funding constraints, regulatory burdens, or other challenges, and merging with a larger charity is a way to ensure their assets and mission continue.
# - Mergers of charities into **a new structure (CIO or charitable company)**.

transferor_freqs

# %% [markdown]
# Most registered transferors have only been in the position of transferring charity once or twice.
#
# This makes sense, since the transferor charity typically ceases to exist as a separate entity after the merger. 
#
# The outcomes of a merger, as stated by the [Guidance about the register of merged charities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities/guidance-about-the-register-of-merged-charities#why-register):
#
# > - your charity has closed or will close as a result of transferring your assets or
# > - your charity has not closed only because it has permanent endowment which will not be transferred to the charity you are merging with
#
# These repeat transferors might be falling into this second case.
