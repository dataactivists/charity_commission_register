# Charity Commission register analysis

## Roadmap

This repo aims to be an exhaustive analysis of the data released by the Charity Commission at <https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/register/full-register-download>.

Some of the questions we want to look at:

- [x] most frequent transferors
- [x] most frequent transferees
- [x] evolution of number of mergers per year
- [x] what are the annual returns of the transferee before/after the merger?
- [x] what's the size of transferors/transferees in terms of annual return?
- [ ] what is the median number of trustees per charity?
- [ ] who are "repeat trustees"?

For starters, the analysis covers the [Register of merged charities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-merged-charities) data.
