Unregistered charities are not frequently in the position of the transferee, which is what we'd expect, as transferes are likely to be larger and more established.

There's an outlier that went through 1200+ mergers, while some other transferees have gone through mergers >40 times.

Most transferees only go through a merger <5 times.

Both *Kingdom Hall Trust* and *Victim Support* (and other frequent transferees) seem to be consolidation mergers.
